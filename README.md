# Minefield

A minesweeper game with hooks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  Disclaimer
This game was created with the sole purpose of entertaining my wife whilst also trying out this brand new (at the time) API in react called "hooks", as you can see from the pinned early version of react 16.

I don't plan to update the repo, or to improve the game's design, but I don't want to archive it as I want to keep it running so my wife can still play.

If you want to contribute with something, feel free to open a PR, and I'll check it out when I can :)~

Cheers! üçª
